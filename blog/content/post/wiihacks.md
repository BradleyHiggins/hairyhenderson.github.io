It'd be cool to use the Wiimote and/or nunchuck as an input device to control
I dunno, a drone or something?

Haven't gotten very far, but here's some links for posterity:

- [wiibrew](http://wiibrew.org) - lots of in-depth info, like docs for the various
  protocols and data formats, esp. around the 'mote and nunchuck
- [hackaday category](http://hackaday.com/category/nintendo-wii-hacks/) - relevant
  articles
- [gobot lib](http://gobot.io/documentation/drivers/wiimote-nunchuk/) - i2c for
  the nunchuck
- [nunchucky](https://www.adafruit.com/product/345) from Adafruit - breakout for
  nunchuck and other devices (like the classic controller) to use them directly
